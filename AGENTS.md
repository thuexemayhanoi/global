# Repository contract · thuexemayhanoi/global

- This repository alone serves `https://global.rentbikehanoi.com/` through GitHub Pages.
- Preserve the `CNAME` content exactly: `global.rentbikehanoi.com`.
- Do not touch `thuexemayhanoi/lab`, `/german`, WordPress, domains or DNS.
- Homepage language switcher uses real URL paths. Do not replace with JS-only translation.
- `content/locales.json` is canonical for the initial locale pages. Regenerate with `node scripts/build.mjs` and confirm `node scripts/build.mjs --check`.
- Maintain self-canonical, correct `lang`, equivalent-only hreflang, descriptive metadata, schema, breadcrumbs and sitemap coverage.
- No invented prices, local premises, reviews, licence rules, or statements of service availability.
- No unreviewed mass auto-publishing. Add researched topic/keyword matrix, scoped QA and safe batch publishing before scaling.
- Do not remove or rename a live URL without a redirect/SEO plan.

## Phase 2 matrix rules

- Read `docs/MULTILINGUAL-SEO-MATRIX.md`, `data/seo/taxonomy.json`, and `data/seo/master-matrix.json` before any topic expansion.
- `IDEA` is merely a keyword hypothesis. Do not render it as a page or reference it in a sitemap/navigation/hreflang.
- Run `node scripts/seo/validate-plan.mjs` after changes to the matrix or deployment files; run `node scripts/seo/writer-queue.mjs --locale de --count 2` for a **read-only** research queue.
- First publish pilots must be separately approved and verified before enabling a recurring writer. Never silently publish proposed topics.
